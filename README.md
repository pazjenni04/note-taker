## **Description**

The objective of this note-taking application is to input and save important notes or lists that a user can organize and retrieve at a later time.

## **Usage**

To use this application, the user needs to visit the deployed link https://pencil-that-in-note-generator.herokuapp.com/. Once the user has clicked on the link, they will be presented with the homepage.

Once the user has landed on the homepage, the user can proceed by clicking on "Get Started" and it will then redirect them to the notes page.

After the user is redirected to the notes page, they can proceed with adding any important notes that they are needing to save. By entering a title and adding text to the text area, a save icon will appear on the top right-hand corner of the webpage. By clicking on the save icon, the user can then save the current note they were inputting.

If the user refreshes the page, the note will then appear on the left-hand column of the page to the saved notes area and the text area to input a note will clear.

If the user needs to pull up a previous note, they can always click on the title of the note they are attempting to retrieve and the note will appear on the right-hand column.

Finally, to add a new note, the user can click on the plus icon on the right hand of the page and this will refresh the text area to start a new note.
